# context-pack

context-pack builds a budgeted context bundle for a user prompt: retrieve only the most relevant snippets, rerank, dedupe, and pack them into a fixed token budget with citations. It also places the most important constraints/evidence at the beginning/end to reduce “lost in the middle” failures in long contexts. Outputs a clean “context pack” you can paste into any LLM chat or API call.
